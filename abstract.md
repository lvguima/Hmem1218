In non-stationary industrial processes, operating conditions drift over time due to factors such as raw material variability, equipment aging, and control strategies change, meanwhile, reliable quality measurements are often delayed due to laboratory assays or downstream measurements. These chanllengs causes offline-trained soft sensor models to rapidly lose performance and makes current gradient-based online adaptation methods instability under sparse and delayed supervision. We propose the Retrieval-Augmented Residual Correction (R-ARC) framework, a strictly causal online learning method that adapts soft sensors without updating backbone parameters. R-ARC keeps a pre-trained backbone frozen to provide stable base predictions, and performs reliability-controlled retrieval correction by retrieving historical residual trajectories from an external memory bank. Retrieval query is a condition context snippet that captures the current operating condition and drift representations. Residuals are written into memory only after the corresponding horizon is observed, and the applied correction is reliability-controlled to suppress negative transfer under state aliasing and long-horizon uncertainty. Extensive experiments across public benchmarks and real-world industrial processes demonstrate that R-ARC delivers superior accuracy, stability, and practical efficiency, which highlights its potential for sustainable long-term deployment of soft sensors in drifting environments.
